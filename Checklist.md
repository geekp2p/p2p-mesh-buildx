# Project Checklist

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Connect to multiple relays with automatic reconnection
  Ensures a node rotates through provided relay addresses if a relay disconnects.
- [x] Announce and update public nodes in the DHT for automatic bootstrapping
- [x] Implement a watchdog to detect peer disconnects and attempt reconnection‚êä
- [x] Broadcast online relay lists via gossipsub so peers learn new relays quickly‚êä
- [x] Add a retry schedule to recover the network when all peers have disconnected‚êä
- [x] Design auto-relay fallback so private nodes can reconnect through any available public node
- [x] Persist known multiaddresses so nodes can rediscover each other after downtime
- [x] Document the above mechanisms and provide deployment examples
